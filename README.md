# StressPredictor
This project attempts to use health and fitness data from smartwatches to predict a user's stress levels. A survey was conducted to get the users' health and fitness data from their Apple watches for a period of 90 days and they were asked to self report if they were stressed during that 90 day period or not. Due to limited responses there was a need to generate synthetic data to ensure enough data is available for training. Used CTGAN to generate time series synthetics data. Using the data generated two models were built. One using aggrgate values of the features over 90 days and another using aggregate values at day 30, day 60 and day 90.The model was tehn tested on the data collected using the survey and both models gave an accuracy of 80%
